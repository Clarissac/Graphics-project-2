# Graphics-project-2
This project had us create a raycaster.
The contents are a raycast.c file, an input.json, and a makefile along with the readme.
To run it we would run the command: raycast width height input.json output.ppm
I honestly did not know how to approach this project, I spoke with Dr. Palmer during office hours and a classmate explained a few things but it was still incredibly difficult to understand.
